# Alex's Dotfiles

## About
Made the move to ArchLinux and decided it was high time I put my important configuration somewhere I can get it. Also, I'm bundling in notes and scripts I used while setting up my Arch system. Hopefully this can save some time later down the road.

## Installation

Run the following:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/acmcarther/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/link_dotfiles.sh
```
